## Data Mining

1. According to the reading, the output of a data mining exercise largely depends on the skills of the data scientist carrying out the exercise.

    - [ ] False.
    - [x] True.

2. When data are missing in a systematic way, you can simply extrapolate the data or impute the missing data by filling in the average of the values around the missing data.

    - [ ] True.
    - [x] False.

3. What is an example of a data reduction algorithm?

    - [] Prior Variable Analysis. 
    - [] Conjoint Analysis.
    - [] A/B Testing.
    - [] Principal Component Analysis.

4. After the data are appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, what is a good starting point for data mining?

    - [] Machine learning.
    - [] Creating a relational database.
    - [] Non-parametric methods.
    - [] Data Visualization.

5 - “Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see how effective and efficient the algorithms have been in reproducing data.” This is known as:

    - [] Reverse engineering.
    - [] Overfitting.
    - [] In-sample forecast.
    - [] Prototyping.
